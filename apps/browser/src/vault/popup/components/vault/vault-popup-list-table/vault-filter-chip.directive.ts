 * has to stay on `filterForm` — `filterFunction$`, the view-cache serialization, and the other
 * filter option streams all read it, and the non-table vault header still writes it. So rather than
 * moving state ownership onto the chips, this keeps the form authoritative and syncs both ways:
 * the form seeds the chip, and the chip's edits are written back.
 *
 * Values stay whole domain objects (`Organization`, `CollectionView`, `FolderView`) to match
 * `PopupListFilter`, so `bit-filter-option [value]` binds the same objects the form holds.
 *
 * @example
 * ```html
 * <bit-filter-menu key="cipherType" bitVaultFilterChip="cipherType" [filterOptions]="cipherTypeOptions()">
